/**
 * RLS (Row-Level Security) integration for Prisma.
 *
 * Call `setTenantContext(tenantId)` at the start of each API request
 * to set the Postgres session variable `app.tenant_id`. RLS policies
 * (defined in rls-policies.sql) then enforce that every SELECT/INSERT/
 * UPDATE/DELETE only touches rows matching that tenantId.
 *
 * This is belt-and-braces on top of the application-level `WHERE tenantId`
 * filters. Both layers must agree — if either is wrong, the other catches it.
 *
 * Usage in withTenantAuth:
 *   import { setTenantContext } from "@quikit/database/rls";
 *   await setTenantContext(tenantId);
 *   // ... run queries ...
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This uses `SET LOCAL` which is transaction-scoped. For
 * non-transactional queries, use `SET` (session-scoped) instead.
 * In serverless (Vercel Functions), each request gets its own connection,
 * so session-scoped is effectively request-scoped.
 */

/**
 * Set the tenant context for the current database session/transaction.
 *
 * Must be called BEFORE any tenant-scoped queries in the request.
 * The RLS policies in rls-policies.sql will then automatically filter
 * all queries to only include rows matching this tenantId.
