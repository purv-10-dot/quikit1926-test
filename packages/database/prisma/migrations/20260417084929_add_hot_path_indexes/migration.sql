-- P1-3: composite indexes for hot multi-column queries.
-- See docs/plans/P1-3-composite-indexes.md.
--
-- NOTE on CONCURRENTLY:
-- An earlier version of this migration used CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to
-- avoid an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock during the build. That failed with
-- "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction block"
-- because Prisma wraps every migration file in an implicit transaction
-- (docs/plans/P1-3-composite-indexes.md §4 had this wrong — corrected).
--
-- At current table sizes (<100K rows) a regular CREATE INDEX completes
-- in tens of milliseconds and the brief lock is imperceptible. Revisit
-- if any of these tables grow past ~1M rows, at which point we should
-- either split the migration per-index and run via psql manually, or
-- adopt the Prisma "shadow DB + resolve" dance to bypass the implicit
-- transaction wrapper.
