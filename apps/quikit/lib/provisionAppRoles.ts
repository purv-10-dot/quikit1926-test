/**
 * Fire-and-forget bridge that asks each granted app to seed its own RBAC
 * tables (AppRole / RolePermission / UserAppRole) for a freshly-provisioned
 * org — and, when provided, assign one or more Org Admin users to the
 * seeded admin AppRole.
 *
 * Called from the two super-admin flows that hand an org access to an app:
 *   • POST /api/super/orgs              — create-org-with-admin
 *   • POST /api/super/org-app-access/:  — later grant/revoke toggles
 *
 * Why HTTP rather than a direct Prisma call from quikit: each app owns
 * its own schema (app_quikscale, app_quiktrack, …) and its own permission
 * registry. Calling the app's own /api/internal/provision-roles endpoint
 * keeps the "which permissions exist + how the admin role is shaped"
 * decision inside the app where it belongs.
 *
 * Each call is best-effort: a slow/unreachable target never blocks or
 * fails the grant. The app's own lazy seed (on first authenticated load)
 * remains the safety net.
